# Snake Game

A simple Snake game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats fruit while avoiding walls and its own body. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall, its own body, or the boundaries of the game window.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Fruit**: The snake eats fruit to grow longer and earn points.
- **Walls**: The game includes random wall segments that the snake must avoid. Every 3 fruits eaten, a new wall segment is added.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- **Score Display**: The score is displayed on the screen, and it increases when the snake eats fruit.
- **Game Restart**: After a game over, the game resets and you can continue playing.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Install Pygame by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
